\caption{Accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE) and precision (90\% Distance) 
                  of out of sample predictions. Forecasts were made without random 
                  year effects; only climate covariates could explain year-to-year 
                  variation. 90\% Distance refers to the average distance between the 
                  upper and lower 90th percentiles of the 100 predicted values for 
                  each quadrat-year combination.}
